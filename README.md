# Probability Statistics Problems

## Purpose
This repository lists the simulaitons of some of the probability & statistics problems.

## [1. Birthday Problem](https://github.com/xslittlemaggie/Probability-Statistics-Problems/blob/master/Birthday_problem.ipynb)
- In a room of 2 people, the probability of the two people have the same birthday is 1/365 = 0.2739%
- In a room of 23 people, the probability of at least two people have the same birthday is 50%
- In a room of 40, the probability of at least two people ahve the same birthday is 90%.

## [2. Expectation of min, max, sum of tossing 2 or mroe dice](https://github.com/xslittlemaggie/Probability-Statistics-Problems/blob/master/Expectation%20of%20min%20max%20sum%20of%20tossing%202%20or%20more%20dice.ipynb)

## [3. The expectation of tossing 3 or more dice](https://github.com/xslittlemaggie/Probability-Statistics-Problems/blob/master/Strategy%20when%20to%20stop%20when%20tossing%203%20dice.ipynb)

## [4. Get unbiased generator from biased generator](https://github.com/xslittlemaggie/Probability-Statistics-Problems/blob/master/From_biased_to_unbiased_generator.ipynb)

## [5. The Expectation of the Mininal of Several Independently Identically Distributions](https://github.com/xslittlemaggie/Probability-Statistics-Problems/blob/master/%E5%A4%9A%E4%B8%AA%E7%8B%AC%E7%AB%8B%E5%90%8C%E5%88%86%E5%B8%83%E6%9C%80%E5%B0%8F_%E5%A4%A7%E6%9C%9F%E6%9C%9B.ipynb)

 - k = 3, Expecation(min) = 1/4
